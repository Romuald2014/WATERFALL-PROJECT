## This project demonstrates how to analyze sales forecasts using waterfall charts. By leveraging CRM data, we provide a detailed, step-by-step guide to mastering sales forecasting and pipeline analysis. Ideal for data analysts, sales teams, and anyone interested in making data-driven decisions.

## Introduction
This project focuses on using a Python Jupyter notebook to perform a detailed analysis of sales forecasts using waterfall charts. The aim is to help you understand changes in your sales pipeline and make data-driven decisions.

## Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Romuald2014/WATERFALL-PROJECT/Waterfall-Sales-Forecast.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd Waterfall-Sales-Forecast

Ensure your CRM data is formatted as deal_history.csv and placed in the project directory. The file should include the following columns:

changed_at: Date of the last deal modification
amount: Potential sale amount
stage: Deal stage (e.g., "In Progress", "Closed Won", "Closed Lost")
closing_date: Potential deal closing date
created_date: Deal creation date
